/** Practice Time

Create a top-level constant for the maximum number of books a person could borrow.

Inside the Book class, create a method canBorrow() that returns true or false depending on whether a
user has already borrowed the max number of books.

Create a Constants object that provides constants to the book. For this example, provide the BASE_URL
for all books in the library catalog. Inside Book, add a method printUrl that creates and prints a
URL composed of BASE_URL, the book title, and “.html”.

The base URL is really of interest to the Book class. As such, it makes sense to limit its scope to
the Book class. Use a companion object to define the constant in Book.
